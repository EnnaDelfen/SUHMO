# Welcome to SUHMO's documentation!


## Overview
SUHMO is an adaptive-mesh code for simulating the 2D evolution of subglacial hydrology. SUHMO is parallelized with MPI for CPUs. Support for complex geometries so far is minimal.


## Dependencies
SUHMO relies on the Software for Adaptive Solutions of Partial Differential Equations CHOMBO ([see home page](https://commons.lbl.gov/display/chombo/Chombo+-+Software+for+Adaptive+Solutions+of+Partial+Differential+Equations)).

### Get Chombo 3.2
Start by downloading the feature\_SUHMO branch of the forked version of Chombo 3.2:

```
git clone https://github.com/EnnaDelfen/Chombo_3.2.git
```

### Get SUHMO 1.0


### Get Started !

Start with a very [basic tutorial](https://ennadelfen.github.io/SUHMO/GettingStarted)
